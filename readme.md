# Billing System

## Introduction
- This whole project is based on creating a billing solution for the retail shops where you can keep track of the inverntory sold and which time has most foot-fall so that business can be optimized on the basis of data, and also digitalized bills can be provided to the users.

- There are two files billing_db.py & main.py. In the biling.py I have used the SQLite3 package to store the data in the database and in the main.py I have stored the data in a .txt file by the name bill_info.txt

- So, there are two variations, one in which a database is used and another where no database is used.

## Future Work
There are multiple things that can be done in it like:
- Giving discounts to loyal customers
- Making an inventory management system for the outlets
- Customer can order things from the software
